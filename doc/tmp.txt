Basically ksdft++ solves the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation which reads as follows:
$$ {\hbar^2 \over 2 m} \nabla^2 \psi + V \psi = E \psi $$

with $$ \psi $$ the wavefunction describing the electrons,
V the potential operator acting on the wavefunction,
summarizing terms containing the potential energy field the other electrons create as well as the ions and further quantum mechanical terms. E is the energy of the state $$ \psi $$.
In DFT the operator equation above is not solve using the wavefunction except in the kinetic energy term, but the density, which is interpreted to be the
square of the wavefunction at one space-time point.

The wavefunction lends itself to a probabilistic
description of the underlying dynamics, with its square giving the density n of particles found at one space-time point (x,t):
$$ n(x) = \int dV \psi(x)^{\dagger} \psi(x) $$

$$ E_{kin} = \int_{V} dV {\hbar^2 \over 2 m} \psi(x)^{\dagger} \nabla^2 \psi(x) $$
